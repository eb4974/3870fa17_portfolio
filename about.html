        <p>Hi, I am Jerry!  I started out as a self-made Makeup Artist, assisting my cousin (who is a senior makeup artist) in her appointments which led to my first ever makeup job with MAC cosmetics, in Dubai for about 2 years and continued with the company in San Francisco for another 5 years. I am part Indian and part Filipino, born and raised in Dubai, UAE. Living in such a multicultural city with the combination of my mixed heritage has given me a broader and a more compassionate understanding of various cultures and religions.
 Moving out of my hometown was hard but It had a great turnout. I feltl that it was time for a fresh start and to go out in the world and learn more for what I was passionate about, special effects make up. I am passionate about painting faces and I have been fortunate to travel around the world for fashion weeks, photoshoots, destination weddings and makeup workshops however I wanted more than just doing beauty makeup. My makeup style is more classic and timeless, and as an artist I always look to enhancing my client’s natural beauty as opposed to transforming them to someone else. I am on the constant lookout for makeup brands to play with and add into my my makeup kit and as a skincare junkie, the search never ends for products to play and learn with. There will be plenty of beauty reviews, new discoveries and techniques to sharpen your makeup game here in the upcoming blog section.

I am part Indian and part Filipino, born and raised in Dubai, UAE. Living in such a multicultural city with the combination of my mixed heritage has given me a broader and a more compassionate understanding of various cultures and religions. As much as I love makeup, beauty and fashion, I am also deeply concerned with the affairs of the world and the equality of women. </p>
